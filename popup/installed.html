    <h2>Features</h2>





    <br><b>Glodaquilla - NG </b>is an extension to Thunderbird which allows to control which accounts or 
    folders are included in Global Search and Indexing. Enhancing the standard operation, choices for account or 
    folder inclusion can be inherited/propagated to child folders.
    <br>
        Also adds three columns to the Thunderbird message pane that are useful to monitor downloaded messages (in IMAP, for example) 
        and/or are useful in debugging.
        <br>
 
    Created by R. Kent James (see bugzilla), updated to TB 60/78+ by Klaus Buecher/opto.<br>
<br>
Example: 

    <ul>
      <li> Display whether message has been fully downloaded (in an extra column, relevant for IMAP)
        <br /></li>
 
      <li> Local/private spam or draft or temporary folders and subfolders can be in/excluded from indexing and global search
        <br /></li>
      <li> Archive folders and subfolders or local copies can be ex/included in indexing and global search<br /></li>
      <li> Real useful tool to eliminate that nasty indexing from junk and temporary folders (user comment)</li>
      <li> If you have some IMAP folders with a lot of messages that you do not need to search, 
        this plugin will make Thunderbird run very very fast (user comment)<br />
      </li>
      <li> Display in an extra column whether message is to be indexed ("gloda-dirty")
        <br /></li>
        <li> Display in an extra column whether message has been indexed for search (if gloda-id is > 2, it cannot be indexed if = 2)
          <br /></li>
      </ul>
